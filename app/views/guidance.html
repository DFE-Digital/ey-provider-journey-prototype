        Find out if you’re eligible as an early years educator
      </h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">To be eligible for a payment as an early years educator, you must:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>have applied for a role with an attached incentive at an eligible nursery</li>
      <li>be on a permanent contract</li>

      <li>spend most of the time (70% or more) in your role working directly with children</li>

      <li>guiding, supporting and interacting with children in their learning and development</li>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>are an apprentice, even if you’re on a permanent contract during your apprenticeship – once you complete your apprenticeship and move into a permanent non-apprenticeship role, you will become eligible</li>

        <li>3. DfE will contact the nursery after 6 months to see if the early years educator is still in the role.</li>
        <li>4. If the early years educator is still in the role, DfE will pay the bonus into their bank account.</li>

        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">
          Complete the claim as an early years educator

      <p>DfE will send the early years educator an email confirming that their employer has started the claim on their behalf.</p>
      <p>The early years educator should complete the claim as soon as possible. DfE will make the payment to the early years educator’s bank account once they’ve been in their role for 6 months.</p>
      <p>Any funding they’ve received to study for a college course or apprenticeship will not affect the bonus.</p>

        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">
          Reapply for the scheme after leaving employment

       <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">National Insurance and Income Tax</h2>
      
      <p>DfE will pay National Insurance and basic rate Income Tax on the recruitment bonus on behalf of an early years educator.</p>
      <p>If an early years educator earns £50,270 or more a year, they’ll need to pay any Income Tax at the higher rate through PAYE.</p>
      <p>The bonus is not part of an early years educator’s salary from their employer.</p>
      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        The recruitment bonus, along with the Income Tax and National Insurance contributions made on the early years educator’s behalf, will count towards their income.
      </div>

      <p>The educator, nursery or the government will not make a contribution to the early years educator’s pension as part of the payment.</p>
      <p>Early years educators should consider how receiving a recruitment bonus will affect any other benefits or tax credits they receive, such as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-credit-and-earnings">Universal Credit</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you have a student loan</h2>

      <p>A deduction may come out of an early years educator’s bonus if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>they’re currently repaying a student loan</li>
        <li>their bonus takes them over the threshold amount for their repayment plan</li>
