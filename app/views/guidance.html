        Overview
      </h2>
      
      <p>This scheme enables nurseries to receive a number of £1000 payments to attach to job adverts to recruit practitioners. These can be used to recruit for part and full-time roles.</p>
      <p>The aim is to support nurseries with recruitment and increase the number of permanent practitioners in the early years workforce.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Local authorities participating in this scheme
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can only participate in this scheme if your nursery is in one of these local authorities:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>local authority name</li>
      <li>local authority name</li>
      <li>local authority name</li>
      <li>local authority name</li>
      <li>local authority name</li>
      <li>local authority name</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        How it works
      </h2>
      
      <p>Nurseries in your local authority can use financial incentives to recruit staff. They can either be new to the sector, returning after a break of at least 6 months or moving from a temporary to permanent contract.</p>
      <p>After you’ve recruited an eligible new employee, you need to start a claim on their behalf on a digital service. The employee will then receive an email inviting them to complete the claim.</p>
      <p>After 6 months you’ll be asked to confirm that they are still in their role. If they are, they will then receive the £1000 payment.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        How money is allocated
      </h2>
      
      <p>The Department for Education has allocated funding to enable you to request a number of £1000 payments to use to recruit staff.</p>
      <p>Payments will be allocated to nurseries in the order they are requested (on a first come, first served basis).</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Nursery eligibility
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Your nursery is eligible if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>it's in [named local authority areas]</li>
      <li>you have been contacted and told the nursery is eligible to offer payments</li>
      <li>you’re currently implementing the early years foundation stage (but are not running a reception class or childminding setting)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Practitioner eligibility
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Applicants who are new or returning to early years are eligible if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>they have not worked in a permanent role in a nursery in the 6 months before starting their new role, where they spent most of their time (70% or more) working directly with children</li>
      <li>the role they’ve applied for is a permanent contract (this applies to part and full-time roles)</li>
      <li>they’ll spend most of the time  (70% or more) in their role working directly with children</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Applicants do not need to have any early years qualifications or have worked in a nursery before.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">You cannot offer the incentive to anyone who:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>has worked in a permanent role in a nursery in the last 6 months</li>
      <li>will not be spending most of their time (70% or more) working directly with children in their new role</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Working directly with children</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">Working directly with children can involve any of the following:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>working in the room with children — this can include playrooms, base rooms and classrooms</li>
      <li>guiding, supporting and interacting with children in their learning and development</li>
      <li>giving hands-on care, including health and hygiene</li>
      </ul>

      <p>70% or more time applies to all part and full-time roles. The employee does not need to work a minimum number of contracted hours to be eligible.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Apprenticeships
      </h2>

      <p>Apprentices cannot receive a payment, even if they’re on a permanent contract during their apprenticeship.</p>
      <p>Apprentices could receive a payment when they move from being an apprentice to an employee. To do this, they must have passed their apprenticeship and been taken on in a permanent role.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        How practitioners are paid
      </h2>

     <p>The Department for Education will pay the money directly into the employee’s bank account. This will happen after they have been in the role for 6 months.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Tax and deductions
      </h2>

      <p>The Department for Education will cover the cost of the employee’s Income Tax and National Insurance contributions.</p>
      <p>There may be other deductions based on the employee’s circumstances. For example, if they’re making student loan repayments. This could reduce the final amount of the incentive below £1000.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Student loan</h3>

      <p>Any funding the employee has previously received to study for a college course or apprenticeship will not be affected by the £1000 payment.</p>
      <p>If they have previously studied at university, their £1000 payment may affect their student loan repayments.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If they’re currently repaying a student loan</h3>

      <p>If they’re currently repaying a student loan, a deduction towards it may come out of their £1000 payment.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If they have a student loan but are not currently repaying it</h3>

      <p>If their payment takes them over the amount they must earn to start paying back a student loan, a deduction may go towards repaying it.</p>
      <p>Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/when-you-start-repaying" class="govuk-link">when they would start paying back a student loan</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/what-you-pay" class="govuk-link">what they’ll pay</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        If the employee leaves before they’ve been in the role for 6 months
      </h2>

      <p>The employee must complete 6 months in their role to receive the payment. We'll contact you by email before that point to check your employee is still working in their role.</p>
      <p>You need to tell us by email if your employee leaves your nursery before they have completed 6 months. You can do this by contacting us at opsteam@education.gov.uk.</p>
