      <li>guiding, supporting and interacting with children in their learning and development</li>

      <p class="govuk-body">You’re also eligible for the scheme as an early years educator if you:</p>

      <li>are new to the sector</li>
      <li>are moving from a temporary contract or apprenticeship to a permanent contract</li>

        How to apply
      </h1>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">Early years providers start the claim on behalf of an early years educator. DfE will then email the educator to complete the claim.</p>

      
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>applied for a role with an incentive attached </li>
      <li>started in their new role between [eligibility window start date] and [eligibility window end date]</li>

      <p class="govuk-body">EY educators can either be:</p>

      <li>moving from a temporary contract or apprenticeship to a permanent contract</li>
      <li>returning after a break of at least 6 months</li>
      </ul>   

      <p class="govuk-body">Once an EY educator has started their new role:</p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>The nursery needs to <a href="/landing-page">start a claim on their behalf</a>.</li>

        <li>After 6 months, the nursery will be asked via email to confirm that the EY educator is still in their role.</li>
        <li>If the EY educator is still in their role, DfE will pay the recruitment bonus directly into their bank account.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>If an EY educator receives a recruitment bonus and then leaves their job, they can apply for the payment again in the future. They must meet the following conditions to be eligible:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>in the 6 months before applying again, they cannot work directly with children for 70% or more of the time in their new role</li>

          Eligible early years educators
      </h1>

      <p>EY educators who are new or returning to an early years setting are eligible if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the role they’ve applied for is a permanent part-time or full-time contract - they do not need to work a minimum number of contracted hours to be eligible</li>
        <li>they’ll spend most of the time (70% or more) in their role working directly with children</li>
        <li>they have not worked in a permanent nursery role in the 6 months prior to starting their new role, where they spent most of their time (70% or more) working directly with children</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Applicants do not need to have any early years qualifications or have worked in a nursery before.</p>
      <p>EY educators are not eligible for a £1,000 recruitment bonus if they are:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>an employee who has returned from a long period of leave, such as maternity leave</li>
        <li>on a non-permanent contract - such as a temporary, voluntary or agency contract</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Apprenticeships
      </h2>

      <p>Recruitment bonuses are not available to apprentices, even if they have a permanent contract during their apprenticeship.</p>
      <p>Apprentices can receive a recruitment bonus when they move from being an apprentice to an employee. To qualify, they must:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>complete their apprenticeship</li>
        <li>be taken on in a permanent part-time or full-time role</li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Working directly with children
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Working directly with children can involve any of the following:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>working in the room with children - this can include playrooms, base rooms and classrooms</li>
      <li>guiding, supporting and interacting with children in their learning and development</li>

      </ul>

      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Income Tax, National Insurance and pensions
      </h1>
      <p>We’ll pay National Insurance and basic rate Income Tax for the recruitment bonus on behalf of the EY educator. If an EY educator earns £50,270 or more per year, they’ll need to pay any Income Tax at the higher rate through PAYE.</p>
      <p>The bonus is not part of the EY educator’s salary from their employer. The EY educator, the nursery or the government will not make a contribution to the EY educator’s pension as part of the payment.</p>
      <p>The recruitment bonus, along with the Income Tax and National Insurance contributions made on the EY educator’s behalf, will count towards their income. EY educators should consider how this will affect any other benefits or tax credits they receive, such as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-credit-and-earnings">Universal Credit</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Student loan</h2>

      <p>The £1,000 recruitment bonus will not be affected by any funding the EY educator has previously received to study for a college course or apprenticeship.</p>
      <p>If the EY educator has previously studied at university and has a student loan, the following conditions apply:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>if they’re currently repaying a student loan, a deduction towards it may come out of their £1,000 recruitment bonus</li>
        <li>if their recruitment bonus takes them over the amount they must earn to start paying back a student loan, a deduction may go towards repaying it</li>
      </ul>
