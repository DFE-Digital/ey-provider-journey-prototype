      What you’ll need to complete a claim
    </h2>

    <p>Once your employer has started a claim on your behalf, you’ll receive an email inviting you to complete it. The email will contain a claim reference number, which you’ll be asked to enter in the next step.</p>
    <p>You’ll also need:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a form of photo ID, such as a passport or driving licence - this is so that we can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/using-your-gov-uk-one-login/proving-your-identity">verify your identity</a> via GOV.UK One Login</li>
      <li>your address, email address and National Insurance number</li>
      <li>your bank details – this is so that we can pay your recruitment bonus to you directly</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">Your recruitment bonus will be paid after we’ve confirmed with your employer that you’ve been in the role for 6 months.</div>


    <p>The application should take no longer than 15 minutes to complete. To protect your information, each page will time out after 30 minutes.</p>
