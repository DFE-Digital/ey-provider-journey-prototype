      Use this service to make an early years financial incentive payment claim for an employee. 
      </h2>
  
      <p>To make a claim for an employee, they must:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>have applied for a job with an incentive attached</li>
        <li>have started their job after 15 May 2024</li>
        <li>spend most of the time in their role, working directly with children</li>
      </ul>

      <p>'Most of their time' means:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>70% or more of their contracted hours are spent working directly with children</li>
      </ul>

      <p>'Working directly with children' could involve any of the following:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>guiding children in their learning</li>
        <li>supporting children with their learning and development</li>
        <li>interacting with children</li>
        <li>giving hands-on care</li>
        <li>working 'in the room', in nursery settings that have 'rooms'</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Other conditions for the payment
      </h2>

      <p>The purpose of this incentive scheme is to increase the number of people working with children in permanent roles, within the early years sector.</p>
      <p>So to make a claim for an employee, they must also have:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>not worked in early years in the six months before starting their current role</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Or alternatively if they did work in early years in the 6 months before starting their current job, this can have been in any of the following types of employment:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Casual employment and temporary work including:</li>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>zero-hour contracts</li>
          <li>guaranteed minimum hour contracts</li>
          <li>self-employed or freelance contracts</li>
          <li>fixed term contracts (FTCs)</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>voluntary or unpaid work</li>
      </ul>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>permanent employment, where their role involved working with children less than 70% of their time:</li>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>This means the main focus of their role did not involve working directly with children. Examples of this might include people who worked previously as gardeners, chefs, or administrators.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
